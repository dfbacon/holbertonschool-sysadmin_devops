0x0A. Load balancer
 Sysadmin & Devops ― Web stack

 by Sylvain Kalache

 Ongoing project - started 02-28-2017, must end by 03-06-2017 (in 3 days) - you're 0% done.

 QA review fully automated.

For this project, students are expected to look at this concept:
Load balancer
Readme:

Introduction to load-balancing and HAproxy
HTTP header
You have been given 2 additional servers:

[STUDENT_ID]-web-02
[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01
Let's improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.

Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.3-1~ubuntu14.04.1 via apt-get) without any error
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

0. Double the number of webservers mandatory

In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they'll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we're placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck
Using the Bash scripts you built for your web server, write 0-custom_http_response-header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-01
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 54.89.38.100 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-02
sylvain@ubuntu$
If your server's hostnames are not properly configured, follow this tutorial.

1. Install your load balancer mandatory

Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
Make sure that your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02. If not, follow this tutorial.
For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -Is 54.210.47.110
