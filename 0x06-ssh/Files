0x06. SSH
 Sysadmin & Devops ― Security

 by Sylvain Kalache

 Ongoing second chance project - started 02-20-2017, must end by 03-06-2017 (in 3 days) - 75% done.

 QA review fully automated.

For this project, students are expected to look at this concept:
Server
Readme

Read:

What is a (physical) server - text
What is a (physical) server - video
SSH essentials
man: ssh, ssh-keygen, env

What you should learn from this project

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is a server
Where server usually live
What is SSH
How to create an SSH RSA key pair
How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash for instance is that it will make your script portable for different OS where Bash might be in a different location.

Congratulations on your first server!

Dude dancing because he is excited about the SSH server attribution

Along with this project, you have been attributed a Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. We've configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a previous project shared in your intranet profile.

You can access your server information in the my servers section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via ssh.

0. Use a private key mandatory

Score: 0.00% (completion score: 0.00%)
Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/holberton with the user ubuntu.

Requirements:

Only use ssh single-character flags
You cannot use -l
Do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase

1. Create a SSH key pair mandatory

Score: 0.00% (completion score: 0.00%)
Write a Bash script that creates a RSA key pair.

Requirements:

Name of the created private key must be holberton
Number of bits in the created key to be created 4096
The created key must be protected by a passphrase
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ls
1-create_ssh_key_pair
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-create_ssh_key_pair
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in holberton.
Your public key has been saved in holberton.pub.

2. Client configuration file mandatory

Score: 0.00% (completion score: 0.00%)
Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, let's configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:

Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/holberton
Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
Example:

In the example above, we can see that ssh tries to authenticate using holberton and do not try to authenticate using a password. You can replace 98.98.98.98 by the IP of your server for testing purpose.

Now that you successfully connect to your server, we would also like to join the party.

Add the SSH public key bellow to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.
