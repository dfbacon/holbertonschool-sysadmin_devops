Your servers without a firewall...

When your firewall is OFF

Readme

What is a firewall
As explained in the web stack debugging guide, telnet is a very good tool to check if sockets are open with telnet IP PORT. For example, if you want to check if port 22 is open on web-02:

sylvain@ubuntu$ telnet web-02.holberton.online 22
Trying 54.89.38.100...
Connected to web-02.holberton.online.
Escape character is '^]'.
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2.8

Protocol mismatch.
Connection closed by foreign host.
sylvain@ubuntu$
We can see for this example that the connection is successful: Connected to web-02.holberton.online.

Now let's try connecting to port 2222:

sylvain@ubuntu$ telnet web-02.holberton.online 2222
Trying 54.89.38.100...
^C
sylvain@ubuntu$
We can see that the connection never succeeds, so after some time I just use cltr+c to kill the process.

This can be used not just for this exercise, but for any debugging situation where two pieces of software need to communicate over sockets.

Note that the school network is filtering outgoing connections (via a network-based firewall), so you might not be able to interact with certain ports on servers outside of the school network. To test your work on web-01, please perform the test from outside of the school network, like from your web-02 server. If you SSH into your web-02 server, the traffic will be originating from web-02 and not from the school's network, bypassing the firewall.

Be very careful with firewall rules! For instance, if you ever deny port 22/TCP you will not be able to connect to your server via SSH, and we will not be able to recover it.

1. Block all incoming traffic but mandatory

Let's install the ufw firewall and setup a few rules on web-01.

Requirements:

The requirements below must be applied to web-01 (feel free to do it on lb-01 and web-02, but it won't be checked)
Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
22 (SSH)
443 (HTTPS SSL)
80 (HTTP)
